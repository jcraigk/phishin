      strong How are audio sources chosen?
    p
      | Audio is downloaded from
      a.non-remote<> href='http://bt.etree.org' target='_blank' http://bt.etree.org
      | soon after it is uploaded by tapers.  This usually occurs 8 to 12 hours after a show takes place.  Often, the first source posted will be chosen to get content up as quickly as possible.  However, if the first source contains labeling, splitting, or quality issues, an alternate source will be selected.  In general, Phish.net setlists are preferred as far as labeling/splitting goes.
    p Sometimes sources will be replaced later if a better version becomes available, but this is rare.  For multi-night runs, the same source is preferred, although not always available.
