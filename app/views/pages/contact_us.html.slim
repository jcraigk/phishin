      | I woke up one morning in November
      br
      | And I realized I love you
      br
      | It's not your client in front
      br
      | Your models, or the web stack above you
      br
      | It's the way you cling to the code
      br
      | When users try to shove you
      br
      | I'd never go browsing away
      br
      | And come back home without you
